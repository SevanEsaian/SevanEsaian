### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sevan (pronounced sev-on)
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying marine biofilm development through the lens of carbohydrate metabolism, and antibiotic production potential. My biological research experiences include cell and molecular biology, quantitative ecology, and microbial ecology. 

I am expected to complete my PhD in April - June 2024 and I am actively research for jobs in data science, bioinformatics, and R&D. 

My github page consists of code I've used for various scientific projects I've worked on over the years.
